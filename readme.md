Agile principles

- Crystal: A family of methodologies that emphasizes communication and teamwork to achieve project goals.
- The Crystal agile methodology is an agile framework which puts focus on the interaction among individuals rather than on the processes and tools used. [It empowers teams to find their own solutions to problems instead of being confined by rigid methodologies of doing things](https://buildd.co/product/crystal-agile-methodology)[3](https://buildd.co/product/crystal-agile-methodology). [The Crystal family focuses on the realization that each project has unique characteristics](https://www.toolsqa.com/agile/crystal-method/)[4](https://www.toolsqa.com/agile/crystal-method/).
